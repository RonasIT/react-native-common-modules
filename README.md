# React Native Common Modules

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Start app for local development: `npx nx start {app-name}`
   - Use [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) to run mobile version

## Generate code

### Shortcut scripts

See `package.json` for NX generator command shortcuts.

#### 1. Generate a library

```sh
npm run g:library {app|shared}/{context?}/{type}/{name}
```

Examples:

```sh
npm run g:library mobile/client/features/profile-settings
# generate a "profile-settings" feature library in "client" context for "mobile" app

npm run g:library shared/ui/ui-kit
# generate a "ui-kit" ui-library shared between all apps
```

#### 2. Generate components

- `npm run g:component --lib={library}` - generate a root component in some library
- `npm run g:subcomponent --lib={library} --name={name}` - generate a library sub-component.

Examples:

```sh
npm run g:component --lib=mobile/client/features/profile-settings
# generate a root component.tsx for feature library "profile-settings" in "client" context for "mobile" app

npm run g:component --lib=mobile/shared/ui/ui-kit --name=button
# generate an exported "button/component.tsx" component inside the "ui-kit" library

npm run g:subcomponent --lib=mobile/client/features/profile-settings --name=settings-form
# generate "components/settings-form/component.tsx" sub-component inside the "profile-settings" library

```

### Use NX-generators directly

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators.
Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Navigate to [@nx/expo](https://nx.dev/packages/expo/generators) for see more available generators.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json` . Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/run-tasks).
